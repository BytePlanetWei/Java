In the Java SE API documentation, Unicode code point is used for character values in the range between
U+0000 and U+10FFFF, and Unicode code unit is used for 16-bit char values that are code units of the 
UTF-16 encoding. 

For more information on Unicode terminology, refer to the Unicode Glossary.
